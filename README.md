# 👋 Hi there, I’m **Shagufta آفرین**

> 🛡️ Cybersecurity & CS Masters student by day, chai-powered portfolio builder by night.  
> I break things (legally) so others don’t have to.

### 🔧 What I Do  
- Major in **Cybersecurity** & **Computer Science** — currently locking in the fundamentals and then wrecking bad actors.  
- Building portfolios for people — because your work should *look* as good as it works.  
- Fluent in “I’ll fix that one weird bug the moment I finish one more sip of chai”.

---

### 🧠 Skills & Technologies  
Here are some of the strong suits I’m sharpening:  
- Cybersecurity fundamentals: threat modelling, vulnerability assessment, incident response  
- Core CS foundations: algorithms, data structures, system design  
- Web portfolio development: HTML, CSS, JS, responsive design  
- I’m actively diving into: **network forensics**, **penetration testing**, **secure web app development**

### 💡 Fun Facts & Extras  
- I **survive on chai and sheer willpower** (and maybe too many tabs open).  
- I write code so clean, my future self asks “who are you even?”.  
- I once tried to explain network packets to a family member and they thought I worked for a spy movie.
